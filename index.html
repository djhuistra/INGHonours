									<h2>A SOFTWARE AGILITY TESTBED</h2>
									<!--<p>An ING Honours Project for UT-BSc Students in Computer Science</p>-->
								</header>
								<p>
									The software agility testbed is a set of 10 repositories implementing mutiple version of a toy banking system. Each repository uses a different approach to implement the system. Each version of the system is a fixed set of functionality requirements. The result is a set of repositories that can be used to compare different approaches towards implementing a software system that deals with a high number of changing requirements.
									<br/><br/>
									This website contains the information required to use this free to use dataset. The <a href="setup.html">setup page</a> describes how the project was setup and what requirements where implemented. The <a href="results.html">results page</a> describes the resulting repositories and links towards the different version of each repository. The <a href="about.html">about page</a> gives an overview of everyone involved in creating this testbed.
									<!--Over the period of a year or so, a group of 12 BSc students, sponsored by the ING, have worked very hard to create multiple versions of a toy banking system, on top of which they then implemented up to 12 different functional extensions.-->

										<h3>The goal</h3>
									</header>

									The goal of this project was to create a dataset of comparable software repositories that can be used to better study software agility. The purpose of studying software agility is to better understand how different approaches towards implementing software deal with the changing requirements of real-world software. This is often difficult to study as real-world software is hard to compare to each other. In order to aid such study, this project aimed at developing a set of software repositories that use different approaches towards implementing the same requirements and should therefore be comperable to each other.
									<br/><br/>
									To this purpose a group of students where tasked with implementing software. Over the period of a year a group of 12 students worked part-time on this project. The students developed software with similar functionality but they used different approaches to implement this software. The software was also developed in a manner that aims to simulates the real-world development of software through changing functionality requirements that where not know beforehand.
				
									<!--<ul>-->
									<!--<li>The project has yielded a unique and valuable resource for future research.-->
<!--<i>Such a multiple-versioned, controlled sequence of software changes provides hugely valuable sample data for understanding how software evolves, and what makes its evolution difficult</i></li>-->
									<!--<li>The project represents a unique cooperation model between academia and industry-->
<!--</i>The project addresses a major challenge at ING; moreover, the students are attractive as potential future employees</i></li>-->
